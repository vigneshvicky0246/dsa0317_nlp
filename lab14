DISCRIPTION:-
Function check_agreement:
This function takes a sentence and a grammar as inputs.
It tokenizes the sentence using NLTK's word_tokenize.
It attempts to parse the sentence using a ChartParser with the provided grammar.
If a parse tree is successfully generated, it returns True, indicating that the sentence adheres to the grammar rules (subject-verb agreement is correct).
If no parse tree is generated (a StopIteration exception is caught), it returns False, indicating that the sentence does not adhere to the grammar rules (subject-verb agreement is incorrect).
Grammar Definition:
agreement_grammar is a CFG defined using NLTK's CFG.fromstring method.
The grammar includes rules for singular and plural noun phrases (NP_SG, NP_PL) and verb phrases (VP_SG, VP_PL).
It defines determiners (Det_SG, Det_PL), nouns (N_SG, N_PL), and verbs (V_SG, V_PL) with appropriate forms for singular and plural cases.
Sentences to Check:
Two sentences are provided: "the cat chases" and "the cats chases".
Agreement Check:
The function check_agreement is called for each sentence.
The results are printed, indicating whether each sentence has correct subject-verb agreement.

CODE:-
import nltk
def check_agreement(sentence, grammar):
    parser = nltk.ChartParser(grammar)
    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(sentence)
    
    try:
        parse_tree = next(parser.parse(tokens))
        return True
    except StopIteration:
        return False
agreement_grammar = nltk.CFG.fromstring("""
    S -> NP_SG VP_SG | NP_PL VP_PL
    NP_SG -> Det_SG N_SG
    NP_PL -> Det_PL N_PL
    VP_SG -> V_SG
    VP_PL -> V_PL
    Det_SG -> 'the'
    Det_PL -> 'the'
    N_SG -> 'cat'
    N_PL -> 'cats'
    V_SG -> 'chases'
    V_PL -> 'chase'
""")
sentence1 = "the cat chases"
sentence2 = "the cats chases"
result1 = check_agreement(sentence1, agreement_grammar)
result2 = check_agreement(sentence2, agreement_grammar)
print(f"Sentence 1 Agreement: {'Yes' if result1 else 'No'}")
print(f"Sentence 2 Agreement: {'Yes' if result2 else 'No'}")

OUTPUT:-
Sentence 1 Agreement: Yes
Sentence 2 Agreement: No
