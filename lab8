DISCRIPTION:-
train_pos_tagger(sentences)
This function takes a list of sentences, where each sentence is a list of word/tag pairs.
It calculates the frequency of each tag for each word.
It then converts these frequencies into probabilities.
stochastic_pos_tagging(sentence, word_tag_probabilities)
This function assigns POS tags to words in a sentence using the probabilities computed by the train_pos_tagger function.
If a word is not found in the training data, it defaults to tagging it as 'NN' (noun).

Enter sentence 2 (word/tag pairs separated by slash or space): The/DT dog/NN barks/VBZ
Enter a sentence to tag:  This is a dog
Tagged sentence:
