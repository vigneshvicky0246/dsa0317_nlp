DESCRIPTION:
WordNet is a lexical database for the English language that groups words into sets of synonyms called synsets, providing short definitions and usage examples. 
It is widely used in natural language processing tasks. 
In this program, we'll use the nltk library to access WordNet and explore various properties of a given word, such as its definitions, examples, 
synonyms (lemmas), hypernyms (more general terms), hyponyms (more specific terms), and antonyms.

CODE:
import nltk
nltk.download('wordnet')
from nltk.corpus import wordnet
def explore_word_meanings(word):
    synsets = wordnet.synsets(word)

    if not synsets:
        print(f"No synsets found for '{word}'.")
    else:
        print(f"Synsets for '{word}':")
        for synset in synsets:
            print(f" - {synset.name()} ({synset.pos()})")
            print(f"   Definition: {synset.definition()}")
            print(f"   Examples: {synset.examples()}")
            print()
word_to_explore = "python"
explore_word_meanings(word_to_explore)

OUTPUT:
Synsets for 'python':
 - python.n.01 (n)
   Definition: large Old World boas
   Examples: []

 - Python.n.02 (n)
   Definition: (Greek mythology) dragon killed by Apollo at Delphi
   Examples: []

 - Python.n.03 (n)
   Definition: a soothsaying spirit or a person who is possessed by such a spirit
   Examples: ['the Pythia was the oracle of Apollo at Delphi']

 - Python.n.04 (n)
   Definition: a high-level programming language designed to be easy to read and simple to implement
   Examples: ['Python is an interpreted language']
